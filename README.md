# Skincare-Analysis-Machine-learning

Motivation: 
We’ve always had a question that we wanted to solve for years. How can we buy skincare products that are meant for our skin types? Every time we tried to buy a skin care product, we found that we got confused from all the fancy descriptions, and weren’t sure whether to buy it or not. We also couldn’t use the ingredients to figure out whether this product was meant for our skin types as we didn’t understand what the different ingredients were as many are written in their scientific name. There were many times when we had bought a product and it had no effect on our skin. Sometimes, it even caused harmful effects to our skin such as causing me to have rashes. We found this to be extremely frustrating as we want to try out new skin care products but are not sure whether it’s for us. I have found that many people that we know of also struggle with the same issue. I was hoping that through this project, we would be able to find a solution to this issue and also make it easier for others to make decisions about buying skin care products.
 
The questions:
Is there a positive relationship between positive reviews and some common ingredients found in products for all skin types?
When given a product, how can we identify what skin type it is for based on the ingredients?.
How does having certain ingredients that are meant for a certain skin type have an effect on how often that product is bought?

     
Dataset:
From kaggle website
https://www.kaggle.com/kingabzpro/cosmetics-datasets?select=cosmetics.csv
 
The challenge goals:
Messy data
We’re going to use a dataset that needs data cleaning to support my analysis.
Machine learning
We’ll use a machine learning algorithm to predict the ingredients for   a product.
External library
We’ll use the Plotly library to build dynamic graphs.
 
Our method: 
We will initially clean the sephora dataset. Then, we would use data visualization to highlight the relationship between common ingredients and positive reviews. We will try to identify what are common ingredients found in products meant for specific skin types. After that, we will build a model that predicts the skin type the product is for based on the ingredients. Towards the end, we will use data visualization to demonstrate the relationship between having certain ingredients meant for specific skin types within products and how popular that product is for people with that skin type.


Our plan:
Data cleaning (2 hour)
Creating models to find relationship between positive reviews and common ingredients and do data visualization (6 hours)
Predicting the common ingredients for specific skin types using machine learning algorithms (10 hours)
Creating models to analyze the relationship between the popularity of the product for a certain skin type and how many of the common ingredients for the specific skin type found within the product (6 hours)   
Preparing the Report (5 hours)
 
Our primary development environment:
VS Code
